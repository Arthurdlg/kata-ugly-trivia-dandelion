# Ugly trivia kata

Goal: learn how to improve legacy code by using acceptance testing

# Instructions

## Step 1 - golden master

You need to set up a golden-master test - feel free to use the
`reference/` folder

You will have to :
* Make sure the production code can run in a deterministic manner,
* Capture messages printed to the console.

Try and do this without changing the production code too much.

## Step 2

Measure coverage and try to improve it.

## Step 3

Start cleaning the code, adding unit tests when you can.
